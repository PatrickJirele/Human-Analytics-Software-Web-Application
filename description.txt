Upload Dataset:
    This page is split into 2 different parts, dataset upload and dateset modification.
    1. Upload
        For the uploading functionality of this page, the administrator is able to select an Excel spreadsheet
        to upload to the site. This spreadsheet will be automatically pre-processed and will display itself with
        the other datasets on the right half of the page. When a dataset is uploaded it is set to the current
        dataset.
    2. Modification
        All datasets available will be displayed on the right half of the page. Administrators will be able to
        delete these datasets with the delete button next to each individual dataset. Administrators will also
        be able to 'select' a dataset, this will regenerate all the non-unique graphs to be updated with the
        dataset selected. When graphs are regenerated, the title in the picture is updated with the title
        given to the graph.

Create Graphs:
    This page is where graphs are created. Graphs will be created using the currently selected dataset. To create
    a graph, you must fill out the form with:
        -Type of graph you want to create.
        -What field(s) you want to create the graph on. The number of fields depends on type of graph.
        -(Optional) Custom title, graph will initially generate with custom title in image.
        -(Optional) Checkbox(s), the number of checkboxes depends on what type graph you are creating. All graphs
        will have one, which if checked will mark the graph as non-unique, if it is unchecked the graph will be
        marked as unique and will not be regenerated when a new dataset is uploaded.

    Once all required fields are filled out, click the submit button and the graph will be created and will show
    up on the Upload Graphs page

Upload Graphs:
    This page is where graphs can be edited, selected to be displayed, and deleted. Each graph on the page will
    have a button for each functionality.

    1. Editing Graphs
        Each graph will have a blue 'Edit' button. When this button is clicked a pop-up will be displayed with the
        graphs current title and description. You are able to edit these fields, and click the update button to
        change them. If you do not wish to edit the graph, you can simply close the pop-up.

        NOTE: When you read a few descriptions you may see "<br>", this is how a new line is created in the
        descriptions. Without this "<br>" the text will all join together and look messy. If you want a newline in
        the description, you must add the "<br>" yourself.

    2. Selecting Graphs to be Displayed
        Each graph has a button beneath the title, but above the picture. This button will either be a green
        'Display Graph' button or an orange 'Remove Graph From Display' button. To add a graph to the dashboard click
        the green button, to remove a graph from the display click the orange button.
